The current working directory contains a file "mary.txt", which in turn
contains the verse Mary had a Little Lamb.

Task:

- Edit that file fixing the capitalisation of the word "mary" (Mary is
  a name, it should be capitalised!).
- Commit your change.
- Create a new git bundle named git-fix-capitalisation.bundle and upload
  that to Einstein:

    git bundle create git-fix-capitalisation.bundle --all
