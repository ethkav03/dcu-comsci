This repo contains two branches, "master" and "merge-me".

(To see *all* of the available branches, try "git branch -a".)

Merge the branch "merge-me" into the master branch, delete the "merge-me"
branch, bundle the resulting repo up into a bundle named "git-merge-branch-2.bundle"
and upload that to Einstein.

Expect a merge conflict, and resolve it yourself.
